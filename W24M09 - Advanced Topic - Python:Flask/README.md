### Why Python?
Here are some reasons why people in the development community think Python is great!

**Readability** - Python's syntax closely resembles English with punctuation rules that promote consistent format.

**Libraries** - Python has been around for more than 20 years. There are tons and tons of resources and libraries that you can take advantage of. If you can think of a task for which you'd like to use Python there is probably a library out there that a skilled developer made just for that purpose.

**Community** - It helps to ask others about things you're not sure of or problems that you just cannot get around. There is a massive community built around Python development built by people who are enthusiastic about Python and always happy to lend a hand!

**Scope** - Python is effective across a broad range of project types - scientific computing, data analytics, machine learning, game creation, web development, and more!

**Ease** - Python has earned a reputation for being easy to learn due to the simplicity of its syntax. It is now the most popular language taught at top universities for instruction on fundamental and advanced computing concepts
